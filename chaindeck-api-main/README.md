# Chaindeck-apiDeployment
I am extremely grateful for the invaluable support and assistance provided by my intern colleagues, Umesh sir and Avinash sir, throughout the duration of the task. Their professionalism and kindness were evident as they consistently demonstrated a polite and supportive attitude towards me, especially during challenging moments.

Umesh sir and Avinash sir were always available to lend a helping hand whenever I faced difficulties while solving problems. They patiently listened to my concerns, provided guidance, and shared their expertise to help me overcome obstacles. Their willingness to assist me at every point of difficulty played a crucial role in keeping me motivated and focused on completing the task.

When completing the task, I encountered several challenges that tested my problem-solving and technical skills. Initially, I faced difficulties in pushing the Docker image from Docker Hub, which delayed the deployment process. Additionally, pulling the local image from Docker Hub proved to be a challenge, requiring troubleshooting and adjustments to ensure a successful retrieval.

Another obstacle arose during the deployment of the ClickHouse database. The intricacies of setting up and configuring the database presented a learning curve, requiring me to delve into documentation and seek assistance to overcome the difficulties. Furthermore, I encountered challenges with port forwarding, which affected the connectivity and accessibility of the deployed applications.

An additional challenge arose when attempting to establish a connection between the PostgreSQL (psql) deployment and the Chaindeck API deployment manifest. Despite initial difficulties, I managed to resolve the issue by creating the psql deployment using a Helm chart. This solution proved effective, and the connection between the deployments was successfully established.

Furthermore, I faced problems related to creating an encoded key-value pair within an environment variable. Overcoming this challenge required research and learning how to properly format and set up encoded environment variables within the Kubernetes cluster.

Through these challenges, I gained valuable insights and knowledge. Firstly, I learned how to push a local image to Docker Hub and utilize it in subsequent deployments. This experience expanded my understanding of containerization and image management. Additionally, I acquired expertise in utilizing encoded environment variables within a Kubernetes cluster, enhancing the security and flexibility of deployments. Lastly, I familiarized myself with Kubernetes Lens, a powerful tool for monitoring and managing Kubernetes clusters, which proved instrumental in troubleshooting and optimizing the deployments.

Overall, while the task presented various challenges, I successfully navigated through them, honing my technical skills and expanding my understanding of Docker, Kubernetes, and deployment methodologies. These experiences have equipped me with valuable lessons that will undoubtedly benefit future endeavors in similar contexts.
